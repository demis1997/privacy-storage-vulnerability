getting the password stored within the contract and converting it to readable format

The trick to this is to find where the password is stored and you can do this through etherscan where you can convert to bytes
Once you have that you just use the get storage command

"web3.eth.getStorageAt" and include the location of the stored password in the parameters for it.

Then you create a new contract on remix connect it to the main one as always make sure you are on the correct network. You convert the password you got from the storage from hex and create a function to push it.
You can also just use the unlock function with the converted password to get it to open.


 Privacy public pushToContract = Privacy(0x0E7FD3C65B2FBDe2656f8D5Eb2673596aB630403);

 function getpass(bytes32 i) public  {
     pushToContract.unlock(bytes16(i));

 }
